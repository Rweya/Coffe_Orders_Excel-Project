Project Background:

This is a Coffee Sales project data between 2019 and 2020. This project tracks different types of coffee beans (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, and Robusta) and provides insight into key metrics such as sales trends over time, sales by country, top customers, and other dimensions like roast type (Dark, Light, Medium), size (0.2 kg, 0.5 kg, 1.0 kg, 2.5 kg), and whether customers have a loyalty card or not. The primary purpose of this analysis is to monitor sales performance, identify high-performing customers and regions, and assess the popularity of different coffee types.

Key Insights:
1.	Total Sales Over Time:
o	Sales for all coffee types show significant fluctuations throughout the analyzed period. Arabica and Excelsa appear to be the most volatile with large spikes in sales, particularly during mid-2019 and early 2020.
o	Liberica and Robusta have a more steady sales trend, although Robusta exhibits a sudden peak near early 2020.
o	Peaks may correspond with specific seasonal demand or promotions, indicating opportunities to optimize marketing campaigns during these periods.
2.	Sales by Country:
o	The United States leads in total sales with $35,639, significantly higher than other regions.
o	Ireland follows with $6,697, while the United Kingdom shows lower sales at $2,799. This indicates that the U.S. market is a key area of focus and Ireland could be targeted for further growth, while the U.K. may need tailored marketing strategies.
3.	Top 5 Customers:
o	The dashboard identifies the top 5 customers, with Allis Willmore leading with $417 in purchases, followed by Brenn Dundridge with $307.
o	The highest spending customers are a valuable segment, and these customers should be nurtured with loyalty programs, special offers, or rewards.
4.	Roast Type & Size Preferences:
o	The breakdown by roast type shows that the sales performance of Dark, Light, and Medium roasts is not clearly visible here but can be further explored to understand customer preferences.
o	Size of coffee sold also gives insight into purchasing behavior, as certain sizes may be more popular in particular regions or among certain customer groups.

Recommendations:
1.	Targeted Marketing for Sales Peaks: The spikes in sales across coffee types during specific months indicate potential seasonality or promotional success. British Airways should consider:
o	Launching promotional campaigns before these high-demand periods to maximize sales.
o	Using historical sales data to predict future demand spikes and ensure sufficient stock levels.
2.	Focus on High-Performing Regions:
o	Since the U.S. market is dominant, further campaigns should be concentrated here, possibly offering loyalty programs or exclusive products to retain customers.
o	Ireland is the second-largest market but could be further tapped by analyzing which coffee types are most popular there and promoting accordingly.
o	The U.K. market shows potential for growth. A localized marketing campaign could help boost sales by tailoring messages and offers to U.K. consumers' preferences.
3.	Customer Retention Programs:
o	The top 5 customers contribute significantly to total sales, so special attention should be given to retaining them. A personalized loyalty program or offering early access to new coffee types and discounts could help maintain their engagement.
o	A referral program through these top customers could also be an effective strategy to attract new clients.
4.	Analyze Product Preferences:
o	Deeper analysis of roast type preferences and size choices could provide key insights into product offerings. If Dark roast is more popular than others, the company should consider promoting it heavily or bundling it with less popular roasts to boost overall sales.
o	Offering specific sizes at discounted rates in regions or among customer groups where loyalty is high could lead to increased repeat sales.
5.	Diversify Product Offerings:
o	Sales of Robusta and Liberica seem to be less consistent compared to Arabica and Excelsa. British Airways might consider promoting lesser-known coffee types with special features or pairing them with more popular options to boost their sales.
Overview of Findings:
The Coffee Sales Dashboard presents a detailed analysis of coffee sales across multiple regions, customer segments, and product types between 2019 and 2020. The dashboard breaks down sales by coffee type (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, Robusta), roast preferences, package size, and the presence of loyalty card holders. Additionally, sales trends over time and performance by country and customer are analyzed to provide insights into sales drivers and areas of improvement.

Trends and Performance:
1.	Sales Performance Over Time:
o	Coffee sales exhibit significant variability over the months for all coffee types, with Arabica and Excelsa experiencing the largest fluctuations. Sales seem to peak during certain months (likely seasonal influences), while Liberica and Robusta show more steady but lower sales performance.
o	The peak sales periods across all coffee types appear during the mid-to-late months of 2019 and early 2020, likely due to holiday demand or special promotions.
2.	Country-Wise Performance:
o	The United States is the largest market, accounting for the bulk of sales ($35,639), which dwarfs other regions such as Ireland ($6,697) and the United Kingdom ($2,799). The U.S. market is a clear leader, providing substantial revenue.
o	There is potential to increase sales in Ireland and the United Kingdom, which have relatively lower sales but could be important growth markets.
3.	Top 5 Customers:
o	The top 5 customers, led by Allis Willmore and Brenn Dundridge, contribute significantly to overall sales, with Allis Willmore spending $417 and Brenn Dundridge $307.
o	This segment of high-value customers should be a priority for retention, as their loyalty contributes disproportionately to the company's revenue.
4.	Product Preferences:
o	While specific roast type sales trends aren't clearly visible, further investigation into preferences for Dark, Light, and Medium roasts could reveal insights.
o	Popular package sizes are not detailed but can be explored further to understand customer preferences, which would help the company adjust packaging and inventory to meet demand effectively.

Recommendations:
1.	Capitalize on Seasonal Peaks:
o	Given the spikes in sales around certain months, the company should leverage seasonal trends by increasing marketing efforts during these periods. Special promotions, new product launches, or discounts can help maximize revenue during peak demand.
2.	Enhance Market Penetration in Ireland and the U.K.:
o	Sales in Ireland and the United Kingdom lag behind the United States, indicating a growth opportunity. Targeted marketing campaigns tailored to these regions, possibly emphasizing locally relevant products or promotions, could help increase sales.
3.	Focus on Customer Retention:
o	Given that the top 5 customers represent a significant portion of sales, the company should prioritize customer loyalty programs. Offering personalized rewards, exclusive offers, or incentives for repeat purchases will help retain these valuable customers.
o	A referral program that encourages high-value customers to refer new buyers could also help increase the customer base.
4.	Analyze and Align Product Offerings:
o	Understanding preferences for roast types and size options is crucial. If certain roast types (like Dark or Light) are more popular, the company should consider promoting these more heavily. Bundling lesser-known varieties like Robusta or Liberica with popular ones may also drive more sales of lower-performing products.
5.	Develop New Promotions and Loyalty Strategies:
o	The company could design a targeted loyalty program for returning customers, particularly those with loyalty cards, to encourage frequent purchases.
o	Special discounts for larger size purchases or promotions on less popular coffee types could help balance the overall product mix and prevent reliance on a single coffee variety.
